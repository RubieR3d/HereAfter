		<h1> Proposal</h1>
		<p>I propose to create a website that is targeted towards individuals suffering from grief following the loss of a parent or grandparent. 
		I recognize that grief can be an extremely difficult and painful process, and my aim is to provide a source of comfort 
		and encouragement during this challenging time.</p>
		<p>The website will feature a range of calming landscapes photographs and inspiration quotes designed to provide hope and support. 
		In addition, I will provide a crisis hotline number, mediative/grounding techniques, and self-care tips to help visitors 
		navigate their emotions and cope with their grief.</p>
		<p>To keep the website engaging and up-to-date, I will ensure new quotes and photos are added weekly. 
		The timeline for the website will begin with a beautiful calming landscape photo greeting visitors, followed by an inspiring quote. 
		Visitors will then be provided with a self-care tip and mediative technique, before finally being presented with a crisis hotline.</p>
		<p>Please note that the photo content will be sourced from free photos found on the internet, while the quotes will come 
		from religious texts or inspirational leaders. 
		I am confident that the end product will provide a valuable resource for individuals suffering from grief and will be a source of 
		comfort and support.</p>
		<p>Thank you for considering our proposal.</p>
